# Contrast Checker

Website that compares the contrast compliance of two colors with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
Made using React.

* [Live demo](https://projects.asantosdev.com/contrastchecker/)

## Serve the site

To start a local server with the site:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Build the site

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files for the site in the `build` directory.
By default, this build assumes the files will be served on a path starting with
`/contrastchecker`. Change or remove `"homepage": "/contrastchecker"` from `package.json`
to serve from root or another path.
